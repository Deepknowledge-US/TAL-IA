This work is related to the forthcoming paper Synthetic video for Sign Language Anonymization.

In this study, we propose two techniques for Sign Language video anonymization. In summary, the main contributions of this study are:

* To provide an overview about the privacy issue due to possible misuse of data, negatively impacting the collection of sign language datasets, which are indispensable for conducting sign language related studies.
* The use of two methods to generate anonymized videos in LSE: one based on Face Swapping and the other based on avatar generation.
* The publication of the anonymized video sets in LSE.
* The evaluation of the impact of the use of anonymization techniques (Face Swapping and avatar generation) on the quality and intelligibility of the content in the LSE videos. This evaluation will be carried out using technical metrics, as well as validation by a group of deaf participants through the creation of a survey.
